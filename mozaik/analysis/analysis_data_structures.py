class AnalysisDataStructure(MozaikParametrized):
    """
    Encapsulates data that a certain Analysis class generates.

    An analysis class can generate several AnalysisDataStructures (ADSs) and
    one ADS can be generated by several Analysis classes.
    The goal is to offer a common interface of such data for plotting
    i.e. many analyses can generate 2D tuning curves of several kinds but they
    all share a common data structure and can be plotted in a common way.

    One important aspect of the ADS design is the notion of parameters as
    opposed to inputs. Each ADS should define a number of Parameters (see the
    documentation on Parameters).
    The importance of parameters is that they will offer a way to identify the
    ADS in the data store (see param_filter_query in queries). 
    Furthermore the constructor of the AnalysisDataStructure can
    accept inputs, which are standard variables that should correspond to the
    data that is actually stored in the ADS.

    The five parameters that each ADS has are:

        identifier -
            An important parameter of each AnalysisDataStructure is an
            identifier which is used to identify data structures of common type
            in storage facilities. Currently different datastructures with
            a common interface should share the identifiers but it is not clear
            yet whether this is needed. If it turns out such sharing is not
            necessary it might be abolished and there will be one-to-one
            mapping between AnalysisDataStructure classes and identifiers.

        analysis_algorithm -
            The identity (name) of the analysis class that produced this
            analysis data structure.

        sheet_name -
            The sheet for which this results were computed. None if they do not
            belong to a specific sheet.

        neuron -
            Neuron id to which the data structure belongs. None if it is not
            neuron specific.

        stimulus_id -
            Stimulus id (as string) to which the data structure belongs.
            None if it is not stimulus specific.

        tags -
            In complicated workflows it might become difficult to design a
            filter to extract the right set of recordings or analysis data
            structures for a given analysis or visualization.
            We do not want users to define multiple AnalysisDataStructures that
            hold the same kind of data only to be able to tell them apart.

            Therefore, we also allow all analysis data structures to contain a
            list of tags (which are strings) that one can add during their
            creation (or later) and use them to later for their identification
            in a DataStore. Queries are written that support filtering of ADSs
            based on tags.

            However, in general, we encourage users to use filter methods
            rather than tags to perform their plotting/analysis whenever
            possible!
